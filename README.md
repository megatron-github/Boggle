# Boggle

The program creates an adaptation version of the Boggle board game. Note that the program will not support the rule such that "when two players submitted the same word, then those words will not be counted." 
The program uses the cs110graphics package to display the board game and create the user interface aspects of the program. The program also supports an unlimited amount of players. Each player has a minute to select all the words they can find. At the end of the play, the program will declare the winner. If the game is tied, the program will state that game is tied. The program will also display the option of letting the users play the game again.
